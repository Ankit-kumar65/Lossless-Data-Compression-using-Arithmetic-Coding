# Lossless-Data-Compression-using-Arithmetic-Coding

This application implementes lossless data compression using arithmetic coding rule ( Lower and upper bound method ). It encodes and decodes a given input by user using
arithmetic coding.
Input can be a number or a String.
The accuracy achieved for decoding is upto 12 characters and after 12, it
may or may not be decode correctly due to probabilities or precision of
double in JAVA.
The Probability of each letter is 0.04.

Encoding part : 

Simply enter the message and click on
‘Encode’. 
For eg, here the user enters
‘Assam’ and receives the resulting encoded codeword.
